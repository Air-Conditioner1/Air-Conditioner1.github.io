## My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, Part 1

    In the first part of the sixth lab, we were tasked with creating a program that was like a sort of mad lib. Basically, the end goal was to be able to construct a sandwich with a type of meat, a type of bread, and a condiment. Although I don't like sandwiches in real life, I certainly had some fun creating hypothetical sandwiches with this particular program, simultaneously using my own imagination to create "sandwiches" that, in reality, just could not exist. This was also during the time when we were especially diving into command line arguments, indexes, and using certain functions like .size() and .at(). After this particular lab, it became easier to use these functions to identify certain indexes.


* Lab 6, Part 2

    In the second part of the sixth lab, we had to create a program in which we would be able to create hands like in blackjack while also ensuring that we supply the appropriate amount of command line arguments and not surpassing a score of twenty-one--which would be a bust. I would say that this was my favorite lab because it incorporated one of my favorite games that I like to play during my free time. Obviously, I don't actually gamble anything substantial, especially not money (and I certainly don't plan on doing so any time soon), but this lab sort of reminded me of the thrill of the sensation of gambling while playing this game. Here, we especially used a lot more operators, including || (or), && (and), inside if statements. I feel that this lab really propelled my understanding of if statements in the context of C++.


* Lab 8, Part 2

    In the second part of the eighth lab, we had to code a short program that would output a certain pattern consisting of '|', '*', and '-' in the terminal. This was probably my second favorite lab because of how cool it felt to be able to print a pattern in the terminal. I've seen others type out entire images and memes using only text, so to be able to do something similar but with code was an interesting experience. Additionally, this lab helped me wrap my mind further around the concept of for loops.
